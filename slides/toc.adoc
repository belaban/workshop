= Workshop outline
Author: Bela Ban belaban@yahoo.com

Modules and labs for a JGroups workshop. The different modules can be combined into a custom workshop.

== Requirements
* JDK 8
* ant
* IDE installed. I used IntelliJ, but eclipse works, too
* Workshop imported into an IDE
** `git clone https://github.com/belaban/workshop`
* (optional) JGroups master (= 4.x) source code imported into the IDE
** `git clone https://github.com/belaban/JGroups.git`
* (optional) jgroups-raft source code imported into the IDE
** `git clone https://github.com/belaban/jgroups-raft.git`
* (optional) Docker



== Disclaimer
Red Hat supports the JGroups versions packaged in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and
Red Hat JBoss Data Grid for clustering use cases in these products.

For supported JGroups configurations, please refer to the documentation for these products or ask GSS.

Red Hat does not support use of JGroups directly from application code or as a standalone module.
The objective of this workshop/training is to provide deeper knowledge of JGroups internals, it does not imply
Red Hat support for this material.




== Day 1: Overview, architecture, API, protocols
* Overview of JGroups
* Architecture
* API
** JChannel, Message, View
** Creating a channel
** Joining a cluster
** Sending and receiving messages
** Handling view changes
** State transfer
** Leaving a cluster

* Protocols
** What do the most frequently used protocols do ?
*** UDP/TCP/TCP_NIO2, PING/TCPPING, FD_SOCK/FD_ALL, NAKACK2, UNICAST3, STABLE,
GMS, UFC/MFC, FRAG3, STATE_TRANSFER
** What are the configuration options ?
