What have we learned ?
----------------------
* Use of JGroups, API and building blocks
* Advanced features
* Design of major protocols
* Handling of network partitions
* Admin tools, e.g. probe.sh
* Flexibility of the protocol stack
** Write your own protocols, or extend existing ones
* Don't be shy to look into the code, it won't bite you :-)



Outlook
-------
* JGroups 5 is the next major version (2018)
* Java 8 as baseline
* Multiple buffers in a message (gathering writes, scattering reads)
** No copying between applications (e.g. Infinispan) and JGroups
* Multiple transports (UDP *and* TCP at the same time), pick transport per message
* Efficient message passing between processes on the same box (shared memory)



Before you go
-------------
* For questions use the mailing lists / IRC
* If you liked this course, please recommend it to others !
** There are more course planned for 2018
* Thanks, and enjoy working with JGroups !
