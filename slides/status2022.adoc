== JGroups
* Small library providing *clustering* to Java applications
* Join / leave a cluster
* Get the cluster *view*: list of members (e.g. `{node1,node-2,node-3}`)
* Send messages (byte[] arrays or objects) to *individual* members
* Send messages to *all* members
* Notification when message is received
* Used by Infinispan to send and receive messages (gets and puts) and to rebalance on view changes


== JGroups 5.2.1

=== Incorrect credits with STABLE
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2605

=== OOME with DONT_LOOPBACK
* Affects `NAKACK2` and `UNICAST3`
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2607



== JGroups 5.2.3

=== Support for unresolved hostnames in TUNNEL
* Useful in cases where Kubernetes doesn't yet have DNS for a pod, when the pod is started
* Instead of failing pod startup, the name will be resolved on a subsequent reconnect
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2615

=== Messages with NO_RELIABILITY are delivered twice
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2620


== JGroups 5.2.5

=== Perf regression from 4.x
* Regression in Infinispan with 100% writes
** Makes sense?
* Haven't been able to reproduce so far
* Working on tools to pinpoint cause of regression, see JGRP-2640
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2632


=== Measure RTT times for requests
* Kind of moot as `RpcDispatcher` is not used any longer (`JChannel` is)
* Output:

[source]
----
A:
  total: 191,74us/7,25ms/247,85ms
  down-req: 4,35us/1,60ms/125,96ms
  network req: 25,46us/277,89us/75,01ms

  up-req: 5,27us/1,03ms/122,01ms

  processing time: 724ns/6,27us/18,32ms

=== Non-blocking API for counters
* Is implemented by jgroups-raft
* Used to implement *Strong Counters* in Infinispan
* Sample code:
[source,java]
----
public void testChainAddAndGet() {
    List<AsyncCounter> counters = createAsyncCounters("chain-add-and-get");

    CompletionStage<Long> stage = counters.get(0).addAndGet(5)
            .thenCompose(value -> counters.get(0).addAndGet(value));
    stage.thenAccept(value -> assertEquals(10L, (long) value))
         .toCompletableFuture().join();

    List<CompletionStage<Boolean>> checkValueStage = new ArrayList<>(counters.size());
    Function<Long, Boolean> isTen = value -> value == 10;
    for (AsyncCounter c : counters) {
        checkValueStage.add(c.get().thenApply(isTen));
    }
    for (CompletionStage<Boolean> c : checkValueStage) {
        assertTrue(c.toCompletableFuture().join());
    }
    assertAsyncValues(counters, 10);
}
----
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2614

=== Multi-release JAR
* To use *virtual threads* (fibers)
* Problem with Wildfly: they cannot use preview features
* Currently disabled: building with JDK 11 rather than 20
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2631


== JGroups 5.2.6

=== Add heartbeating to TUNNEL
* Firewalls or hanging GossipRouters would not remove a connection -> delays trying to send over
  a failed connection (with multiple connections)
* Added client -> GossipRouter heartbeating (not the other way round!)
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2634


== JGroups 5.2.9

=== Measure how long each protocol takes to process messages
* Down (send) and up (receive) direction
* Implemented with byteman code injection and a probe handler
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2640
* Demo


== Future

=== io_uring based transport
* Fully asynchronous and no copying between user- and kernel-space
* Uses the Netty impl
* Should speed up things on Linux
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2579

== send-async and piggyback
* Sending doesn't block at all
* Messages sent down can hitch a ride on another message (piggy-back)
* Useful when a thread processing an incoming message (batch) needs to send a message down
  (on the same thread)
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2603

=== Remove flow control, retransmission, fragmentation on selected transports
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2566



== jgroups-raft
* Implements the Raft consensus protocol
* Replicated state (e.g. caches, counters) in a *cluster* (3 or more members)
* State can never diverge, even in the case of a partition (split brain)
* State is stored in stable storage
* Changes to state (e.g. `x = 5`) have to be approved by a majority -> then `x = 5` is *committed*
* Committed changes will never be lost
* No progress when a majority of members is down

=== Demo
