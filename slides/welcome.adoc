Disclaimer
----------
Red Hat supports the JGroups versions packaged in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and
Red Hat JBoss Data Grid for clustering use cases in these products.

For supported JGroups configurations, please refer to the documentation for these products or ask GSS.

Red Hat does not support use of JGroups directly from application code or as a standalone module.
The objective of this workshop/training is to provide deeper knowledge of JGroups internals, it does not imply
Red Hat support for this material.
