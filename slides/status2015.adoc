* JGroups workshops



JGroups 3.6.2
-------------

=== FORK: handling of asymmetric deployments
* If a fork stack or fork channel is not available on all nodes of `{A,B,C,D}`, a sync RPC to all 4 nodes will block
* Wildfly

=== Programmatic creation of a stack doesn't consider system props
* System props such as `-Djgroups.bind_addr` or `-Djgroups.external_addr` now work with a programmatic stack
