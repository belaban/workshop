// Overview of the most common protocols. What does each protocol do and
// what are the attributes that most commonly need to be changed.


Transport protocols
-------------------
* A _transport protocol_ refers to the protocol at the bottom of the protocol stack which is
responsible for sending messages to and receiving messages from the network. There are a
number of transport protocols in JGroups. They are discussed in the following sections.
* A typical protocol stack configuration using UDP is shown below

Protocols
---------

UDP: Transport protocol using IP multicasting to send messages to the entire cluster,
      or individual nodes. Other transports include `TCP`, `TCP_NIO2` and `TUNNEL`.
                    

PING: Discovery protocol. It uses IP multicast (by default) to find initial members.
       Once found, the current coordinator can be determined and a JOIN request is sent
       to join the cluster.
                    
MERGE3: Will merge sub-clusters back into one cluster, kicks in after a network partition healed.

FD_SOCK: Failure detection based on sockets (in a ring form between members). Generates notification
          if a member fails

FD / FD_ALL: Failure detection based on heartbeats. Generates notifications if a member fails

VERIFY_SUSPECT: Double-checks whether a suspected member is dead,
                 otherwise the suspicion generated from the protocol below is discarded

pbcast.NAKACK2: Ensures (a) message reliability and (b) FIFO order. Reliability guarantees that a message
                 will be received. If not, the receiver(s) request retransmission. FIFO guarantees that
                 all messages from sender P are received in the order in which P sent them

UNICAST3: Same as NAKACK for unicasts: messages from sender P will not be lost (retransmission if
           necessary) and will be in FIFO order (conceptually similar to TCP/IP)

pbcast.STABLE: Deletes messages that have been seen by all members

pbcast.GMS: Membership protocol. Responsible for joining/leaving members and installing new views.

UFC: Unicast Flow Control. Provides flow control between 2 members.

MFC: Multicast Flow Control. Provides flow control between a sender and all cluster members.
                    
FRAG2: Fragments large messages into smaller ones and reassembles them at the receiver. For multicast and unicast messages

STATE_TRANSFER: Ensures that state is correctly transferred from an existing member (usually the
                 coordinator) to a new member.


Transport protocols (UDP, TCP)
------------------------------
bind_addr:: Determines the network interface to bind to, e.g. `bind_addr=192.168.1.5`. The following values
are also recognized:
* `global`: picks a global IP address if available. If not, falls back to a `site-local` IP address
* `site_local`: picks a site local (non routable) IP address, e.g. from the +192.168.0.0+ or +10.0.0.0+ address range.
* `link_local`: picks a link-local IP address, from +169.254.1.0+ through +169.254.254.255+.
* `non_loopback`: picks _any_ non loopback address.
* `loopback`: picks a loopback address, e.g. +127.0.0.1+.
* `match-interface`: picks an address which matches a pattern against the interface name,
                  e.g. +match-interface:eth.\*+
* `match-host`: picks an address which matches a pattern against the host name,
             e.g. +match-host:linux.\*+
* `match-address`: picks an address which matches a pattern against the host address,
                e.g. +match-address:192.168.\*+

bind_port:: The port to listen on. If not set, the port will be picked by the OS. If the port is in use,
            JGroups will increment it until it finds a free port. 
            Example: `bind_addr="10.5.5.5" bind_port="7800"` results in a node's address being `10.5.5.5:7800`.
            The second node started on the same host will use `10.5.5.5:7801`.

enable_diagnostics:: Opens a multicast port which `probe.sh` can use to fetch information from a given node.
                     The multicast address and port can be set with `diagnostics_addr` and `diagnostics_port`. 

NOTE:
Try it out: `run.sh -Djgroups.bind_addr=X org.lab.ChatDemo -props config.xml -name A`


UDP
---
mcast_addr:: The multicast address to be used. If multiple clusters are running, use separate values for
             `mcast_addr` / `mcast_port` and cluster name (`JChannel.connect(cluster_name)`)

mcast_port:: The port to be used for multicasts.



TCPPING
-------
initial_hosts:: A list of _all_ members in a cluster, e.g. `192.168.1.1[7800],192.168.1.2[7800],192.168.1.3[7800]`
* Note that `bind_port` in the transport needs to be `7800`

FD
--
* All members form a logical circle, where each member pings the member to its right for liveness
** Example: in a cluster `{A,B,C}`, A pings B, B pings C and C pings A.

timeout:: The interval (ms) at which heartbeats are sent to the neighbor to the right.

max_tries:: The max number of missed heartbeats for a node to get suspected. So if `timeout=3000` and
`max_tries=3`, then it will take 9 seconds for A to suspect B if A didn't receive any heartbeats (or messages)
from B in that time frame.

msg_counts_as_heartbeat:: If heartbeats are missed, but messages are received from B, B won't get suspected by
A (if true).



FD_ALL
------
* Every node multicasts heartbeats at a given `interval` and collects heartbeats from other nodes, setting
  a timestamp for P when a heartbeat from P has been received
* Every `timeout_check_interval` the timestamps are checked for expiry, and expired members are suspected.

timeout:: Max time (in ms) after which a node is suspected if the associated timestamp hasn't been reset.

interval:: The interval (in ms) at which a node multicasts heartbeats

timeout_check_interval:: The interval (in ms) at which timestamps are check for expiry

msg_counts_as_heartbeat:: A message from P resets P's timestamp (if true)



GMS
---

join_timeout:: The max time (in ms) to try joining a cluster. If it elapses, a new attempt is started.
